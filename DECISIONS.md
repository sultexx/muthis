## DEC-1 (2026-07-19) — Key Files rows mix description with history — DEFERRED

- **Status:** DEFERRED — do NOT act on it before the Phase 1 merge.
- **Observation (root cause):** AGENTS.md Key Files rows mix file description with file history, which is the root cause of the repeated documentation drift (D1–D12).
- **Named examples (still-open drift, to be fixed BY this cleanup — NOT before the merge):**
  - `cloud/tool_schemas.py` row (~line 104): claims "~162" lines and describes the file as holding the LOOK-only schemas, but since Phase-0 M4 it is a ~43-line assembly re-export (the schemas live in `src/muthis_plugins/*/schema.py`) — contradicts the `muthis_plugins/` row (~line 127).
  - the "Planned next: geometric drawing Phase B — do not create until their build step" block (~lines 207–210): contradicts "Geometric drawing (Phase A + B-1 + B-2) is COMPLETE" (~line 438).
- **Proposed (post-Phase-1):** shorten each row to a concise description and migrate the detailed history to `docs/reports/`.
- **Constraint:** Execute the row-shortening milestone by milestone, not in one pass; re-run the full suite after each row — a wide edit to the source of truth must not itself introduce drift.
- **Why deferred:** it is a large edit to the source of truth and must not land before the Phase 1 merge.
